# Agent OS – Personal Workflow Assistant

Agent OS is a cross-platform workflow assistant that integrates directly with Gmail and Google Calendar to streamline daily productivity.  
The project is the foundation for a universal **Agent OS** and eventual **Agent App Store**, where specialized AI agents can be orchestrated under a single unified system.
